I also am an aspiring game designer to portray knowledge accessibly in an interactive way. I am a current junior pursuing a B.S. in Global Public Health with Biology at New York University. My research interests include HIV surveillance, Type I and II diabetes, cardiovascular disease racial disparities, the effect of homelessness on health, LGBTQ+ health, and health disparities. I am open to learning about more topics and aim to learn tools such as R-programming while utilizing my background in MATLAB data analysis to perform research. Some hobbies I have include playing rock/shoegaze songs on the guitar (the F chord is still very painful) and drawing digital art (anatomy is easier to study in a science class than art). Outside of medicine and public health, I hope to learn about game development to understand the creation process behind making games. </p>
